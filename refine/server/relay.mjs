// Refine relay — local server behind the timeline panel's Refine button.
//
// It does two jobs:
//   1. Serves the injectable timeline at GET /inject.js, so any page can show
//      the panel with a single <script> tag (no npm install — see bin/cli.mjs).
//   2. Brokers refine jobs between the browser and whoever answers them.
//
//   Browser ──POST /jobs──►  relay  ──►  answer  ──►  Browser ──GET /jobs/:id──►
//
// Who answers a job (chosen per request via the panel's LLM / Deterministic tabs):
//   • Deterministic → answered in-process by snapping each value to the nearest
//     transitions.dev motion token (zero-config, not usage-aware).
//   • LLM → answered by a real agent. Two ways to provide one:
//       a) A polling agent in your editor: run `/refine live` in Cursor/Codex.
//          It long-polls GET /jobs/next, reasons with the transitions-dev skill,
//          and POSTs the result back. This is the default, install-free path.
//       b) A headless CLI: start the relay with REFINE_AGENT_CMD set and the
//          relay spawns it once per job (stdin = prompt, stdout = JSON).
//          e.g.  REFINE_AGENT_CMD='cursor-agent -p --trust --force' npm run relay
//          (for cursor-agent the relay auto-appends any missing -p/--trust/--force
//          so headless jobs don't fail the workspace-trust prompt.)
//
// Run: node server/relay.mjs   (or: npm run relay)

OPEN usually goes base→open (`fromState:null`, `toState:\".is-open\"`); CLOSE goes open→base (`fromState:\".is-open\"`, `toState:null`). Get the DIRECTION right — open must animate into the open look, close must animate back out.",

For the phase that matches the current DOM, COPY each member's `propertyTimings` straight from the provided `raw.timings` (same per-property duration/delay/easing) — don't change numbers you were handed. The member `selector` MUST resolve in the live DOM RIGHT NOW regardless of phase — use the BASE element selector and do NOT bake the phase's toggled class/attribute into it (write `.t-morph .t-morph-plus`, never `.t-morph[data-open=\"true\"] .t-morph-plus`). The toggled state belongs only in the phase's `stateTarget`/`toState`.",
    "5. TIMINGS ARE PER-PROPERTY. For the OPPOSITE phase (from `cssRules`, or source if none): list one `propertyTimings` entry per animated property with its own duration/delay/easing; `cssRules` already have var() resolved, but if you ever read a raw `var(...)` resolve it to a concrete number, and convert `s`→ms (`0.25s`→250); never emit a `var(...)` or a guess.
